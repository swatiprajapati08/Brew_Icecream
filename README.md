A flutter project using **FIREBASE**
Made a Sign-Up and Register Feature
I made this app by following the tutorial of [**NETNINJA**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfA3NWDBPZ4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC)


With Just a little bit Twist:
Instead of making a **coffee** app I tried to make a **IceCream** app


## What I had learn
-How to create the Login & Sign-up

-How to connect a FireBase to Flutter App

-How to add constraints

-How to fetch data from the Firebase

-How to update the FireBase as soon as User hit the Update Button

-Add the various list 

-As soon as User Register, create the Default database,which user can update later on.

-And many more.
